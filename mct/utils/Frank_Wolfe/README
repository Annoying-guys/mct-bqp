This is the Frank-Wolfe SWAP optimization used in my crowd tracking framework.
This code requires CPLEX to be installed on your machine as it uses CPLEX to solve the linear programing at every iteration of the FrankWolfe.
Part of the code is borrowed from Joulin et. al, video localization paper (eccv14). If you use this code please cite the following:
